# Digital Clock

This is a simple digital clock implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description

This project represents a digital clock showcasing current time and date information. It's a simple and neat utility that can be used for learning purposes or potentially extended to fit other requirements.

## Technologies

- `HTML`
- `CSS`
- `JavaScript`

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: HTML document that forms the structure of the web clock.
- `style.css`: CSS stylesheet providing the aesthetics for the web clock.
- `main.js`: JavaScript file that handles the functionality of the clock.

The JavaScript file contains code to dynamically update the currently displayed time and date. It uses `setInterval` to continuously call a function that updates the HTML elements displaying the clock's hour, minute, second, AM/PM status, day, month, and date. Each of these components are formatted and updated appropriately.

## Setup

To run this project, download the source files and open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.
